## Code Reviews

- The forwarder cog is designed for general-purpose HTTP/HTTPS URL forwarding, not specifically Discord webhooks
- Do not suggest Discord webhook-specific terminology or validation
- Use "Forward URL" instead of "Webhook URL" in messages
- Use "Message forwarding" instead of "Webhook forwarding" in status messages
- Accept any valid HTTP/HTTPS URL as a forwarding target
